This is code for "ECINFusion: A Novel Explicit Channel-wise Interaction Network for Unified Multi-modal Medical Image Fusion"

Dataset: All the multi-modal medical images are from the public dataset: Harvard, https://www.med.harvard.edu/AANLIB/home.html
And the other datasets are all list in our paper.

#Environment requirements reconmmended:
CUDA 11.3
python 3.7.10
